case 1

was driving
then stopped by side of the road
got out of the car (lighter vehicle)
for a certain amount of time
1 person got out, or two people got out
are we able to tell which person is sitting where?


before toll gates or tunnels or bridge
there are deliberately bumpy roads
need to ignore this as an accident case

parked
there was a vibration
should notify the subscriber

need to ask him if we can get vibration data from different parts of the car

vibration (hit something)
and then lighter load (person got out to inspect)

hit the breaks, but still resulted in a collision
(maybe also a collision from the back)

hydroplaning, and ice slippage
