### Velocity/acceleration + airbag acoustic event scenario (a1)

![Alt accident_a1](images/accident_a1.svg)

> * Vel(km/h): vehicle (veh) velocity (vel) measured by the OBD (mOBD)
> * Accel(G): veh acceleration (accel) mOBD
> * SuddenStop(G): veh accel from driver-initiated stop mOBD
> * PhoneDrop(G): accel from dropped smartphone measure by smartphone
> * Sound(dB): in-vehicle sound pressure
> * Airbag(dB): in-vehicle sound pressure generated by airbag release
> * Shout(dB): in-vehicle sound pressure generated by person shouting
> * Speak(dB): in-vehicle sound pressure generated by people speaking
> * SnapshotOBD: last 15s of OBD data
> * SnapshotOtherSensors: last 15s of other sensor data (e.g. sound)
> * SnapshotBlackBox: last 15s of blackbox data

* Based on [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QDbfbPimx4J_werIiUyXG3ZoOR6K9eps/view?usp=sharing), and [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYU_4OLVB49VQrmpePN6T9Jg_qmxFNcf/view?usp=sharing)
* Begin recording accelerometer information and looking for potential accidents only above 15mph
* Ignore any acceleration events below a magnitude of 4G's
* This acceleration change should be enough to detect minor accidents, and is well below the threshold for airbag deployment (~60G's)
* Note: in the event of a sudden stop (driver initiated), although the change in velocity might be large, the actual acceleration event is small because the velocity change occurs over a longer time (unlikely to be greater than 4G's)
* A sudden stop generates approximately 1G [*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYU_4OLVB49VQrmpePN6T9Jg_qmxFNcf/view?usp=sharing)
* When a smartphone is dropped inside a vehicle, it experiences approximately 2G's on the y/z axes, and 3G's on the x-axis before it comes to rest [*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DYU_4OLVB49VQrmpePN6T9Jg_qmxFNcf/view?usp=sharing)

### Sample code for the scenario above

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

const double POLLING_INTERVAL = 0.3; // in seconds (300ms)
const double KMPH_TO_KMPS = 0.000277778;
const double KMPS2_TO_G = 101.971621;

struct DataOBD
{
    double Vel;     // 차속 (Km/h) now
    double VelPrev; // 차속 (Km/h), 300ms before now
};

struct DataOther
{
    double Sound; // in-car sound pressure in dB
};

// takes two velocities (km/h) and returns the magnitude of the
// difference in km/s
double velocityChange(double v1, double v2)
{
    return fabs(KMPH_TO_KMPS * (v1 - v2));
}

double getAcceleration(double v1, double v2)
{
    return KMPS2_TO_G * (velocityChange(v1, v2) / POLLING_INTERVAL);
}

bool accidentDetected(struct DataOBD *obd, struct DataOther *other)
{
    if (other->Sound >= 160)
    {
        return true;
    }
    const double vel = fabs(obd->VelPrev);
    const double accel = getAcceleration(obd->Vel, obd->VelPrev);
    if (vel > 0.0 && accel >= 4.0)
    {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int main()
{
    struct DataOBD dataOBD1;
    dataOBD1.Vel = 1.5;
    dataOBD1.VelPrev = 150.56;
    struct DataOther dataOther1;
    dataOther1.Sound = 65.5;

    assert(accidentDetected(&dataOBD1, &dataOther1));
    dataOther1.Sound = 165.5;
    assert(accidentDetected(&dataOBD1, &dataOther1));
    dataOBD1.VelPrev = 1.56;
    assert(accidentDetected(&dataOBD1, &dataOther1));
    dataOther1.Sound = 65.5;
    assert(!accidentDetected(&dataOBD1, &dataOther1));
    return 0;
}
```

### General Notes
* G-Force: acceleration force experienced by the vehicle occupant
* The soft crush of sheet metal produces low deceleration pulses in the vehicle
* The series of decelerations over a duration of +100ms of a crash may be called a `crash pulse` or a `deceleration curve`
* A crash pulse is characterized by `shape`, `amplitude`, and `duration`
* Glass breakage detectors usually use a microphone which measures any noise or vibrations coming from the vehicle's glass surfaces (narrowband microphones tuned to frequencies typical of glass shattering)
* Airbag deployment emits a high-decibal acoustic event
* In the case of an accident, the smartphone experiences the same acceleration force experienced by the occupants of the vehicle, because smartphones are frequently carried in a pocket attached to the occupants
